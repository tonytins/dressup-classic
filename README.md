# Dress Up Classic

ZC's Dress Up is my original version of my first (and only) flash game I ever got around to making. Dress Up Classic is an attempt to bring that to the desktop using Tauri and Ruffle while also getting myself familar with the vanilla architecture.

## Background

Flash game, aside, this is not the first time I've brought this simple game to a somewhat wider audience in order to get familiar with a web framework. The first time (and where much of the additional assets originate from, such as the CSS code) was as a packaged Chrome App. It stayed on the Web Store until Flash was discontinued.


I didn't think I'd be digging out this old code again for yet another experiment. So far, it works well in development builds. Production, not so much. Regardless, Tauri solves a lot of the shortcomings ofÂ Electron while adopting the good aspects we've come to expect from applications built with it, such as auto-updating.
